### My React Learning Journey

This repo is part of my React learning journey.
It’s basically here where I drop simple components and mini exercises while practicing the fundamentals.

## What’s inside 
 - Basic reusable React components
 -  Mini exercises to practice logic
 -  Very simple styling
 -  Simple lessons I made on concepts like React DOM, Context, etc... *easy to remember and understand*

## why this repo 
 - To help me remember how to implement core concepts.
 - To document my progress as I learn React.
 - To maybe help other beginners who just want simple, raw examples.

  *⚠️ Nothing fancy here it’s more of a learning draft that I can revisit when needed.*
